Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons, we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the basis for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.
