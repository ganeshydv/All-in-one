Serverless application may have lots of APIs
configuring them manually with services will
take lots of time so using automation is 
necessary
- if code is changed then need to change these
endpoint and their configuration so it will
be very hard to this and may be error prone 

- write code --> run test --> deploy 
this is what a serverless deployment process

] AWS SAM ( serverless application Model)

  -version of AWS CloudFormation which 
   is used to create and automate
   deployment of different AWS service
   using a simple text based templete
  -SAM uses same file but simpler form
   suited for serverless
 - CloudFormation converts this file into
  standard CloudFormation templete

] Serverless Framework : 
 - templete is different from SAM
 - have different plugins which makes this
   serverless framework to be used for other
   service other than serverless
   Ex. to build API endpoint (Instead of 
   using AWS API Gateway) along with 
   labmda Fucntion and giving DynamoDB access 
   (Instead of using IAM Role )
   these lambda function using IAM role and can
   define security Groups so controlling traffic
   configuration is also possible 

] AWS CodeCommit : for code base like GitHub
] AWS CodeBuild : allows to build serverless code
         and create or update AWS resource automatically
] AWS CodePipline:allows define delivery or 
        deployment cycle
        from source repository through deployment
