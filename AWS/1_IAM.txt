IAM : Global service
    Used to create Users and groups

IAM USed for : crating and managing
        1) user 2) group 3) role 4) group policies

Groups : can not have sub groups
        : Why crate Groups ?
         - to give directly access to same policies to multiple users
          so not needed to give persmisiions
         independently to each one.

Each group is independent.

Tags: just for additional info for group/user/other aws resource

IAM Policy structure:

{
    "version": ",
    "Id" : "",
    "Statements":[
        {
            "Sid":"1",               // statement identifier
            "Effect":"Allow",        // statements allow or deny access
            "Principle":{             // users:policies applied to which user
                "AWS" :["arn:aws:iam:: ....:root"]
            },
            "Action":[             // list 0f actions this policy allowed to users
                "s3:GetObject",
                "
            ],
            "resource":["arn:aws:s3:::serciceName/*"]  //lsit pf resources actions are applied to
        }
    ]
}


POLOCY :  used for giving certain persmissions to user

General Process:
    user can have access to 
       1> diectly attached policies or 
       2> inherited from GROUP or 
       3> BOTH

Admin Role creates user--> gives certain persmissions --> user gets persmisiions
--> user logs in using aws alias or id and then can work on aws but 
user does not have some acees he will not be able to access those things.


You can create own policies and the structure will be as above
