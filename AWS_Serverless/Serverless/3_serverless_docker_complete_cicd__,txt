but if CICD is only working upto uploading image to ECR then how conatiners will run? I don't find any relation in between them

You're correct in noting that CI/CD, specifically the process of building and pushing Docker images to a container registry like Amazon ECR, is only part of the overall process. The subsequent step involves deploying and running those containers on an infrastructure, and this is where container orchestration services like Amazon ECS come into play.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the workflow:

CI/CD Workflow:

Build Phase:
In the CI/CD pipeline, you build your application, create a Docker image, and push that image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
Container Orchestration:

ECS Task Definition:

In Amazon ECS, you define a task using a task definition. The task definition includes details such as which Docker image to use, the resources allocated to the task, environment variables, etc.
Service Definition (Optional):

Optionally, you can define an ECS service, which is used to maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously.
Launching Containers:

Task Launch:

When you launch a task in ECS, you specify the task definition to use.
ECS Cluster and Agent:

The task runs on an ECS cluster, which consists of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks. Each EC2 instance has the ECS agent installed.
Image Pull:

The ECS agent pulls the specified Docker image from the container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR) onto the instance.
Container Start:

The ECS agent starts the container on the instance, running the application defined in the Docker image.
Service Management (Optional):

ECS Service (Optional):
If you're using an ECS service, it manages the desired number of tasks, handles rolling updates, load balancing, and potentially auto-scaling based on the task definition.
Workflow Recap:
CI/CD Phase:

In CI/CD, you build and push Docker images to a container registry.
ECS Phase:

In ECS, you define a task definition specifying which Docker image to use.

You launch a task in an ECS cluster, and the ECS agent pulls the specified Docker image onto the instance.

The ECS agent starts the container using the Docker image, effectively running your application.

Optionally, if you're using an ECS service, it manages the lifecycle and scaling of the tasks.

Key Points:
Separation of Concerns:

CI/CD focuses on building and packaging your application into a Docker image and pushing it to a registry.
ECS Focus:

ECS focuses on running and managing containers based on task definitions.
ECS Cluster:

The ECS cluster provides the underlying infrastructure for running containers, and the ECS agent on each instance facilitates container orchestration.
By combining CI/CD with ECS, you achieve a continuous delivery pipeline where your application, packaged in Docker images, is seamlessly deployed and run on AWS infrastructure, allowing for scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization.



--> Images are pulled from ecr to run on EC2 or fargate --> by ECS instance and then ---> it runs the docker file as user does in his own pc
