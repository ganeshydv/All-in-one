Q1]router has two ips internal 
   and external is it right

--> end devices : pc, mobile : 1 IP : Internal ( given By DHCP )
   network devices : routers, Gateways : 2 IP's : Internal + External

Yes, that's correct. In a typical home or office network setup, 
both your PC and your router have two distinct IP addresses:

1) Internal IP Address: by DHCP

The internal IP address is used within your local network. 
It's assigned to each device on your local network to 
communicate with other devices within the same network.
For example, your PC might have an internal IP address 
like 192.168.1.2, and your router might have an internal 
IP address like 192.168.1.1. These addresses are often 
assigned dynamically by a service called DHCP 
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or set manually.

2) External (Public) IP Address: by ISP

The external IP address is the address assigned by 
your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to your router. 
This is the IP address that is visible on the internet.
When your devices (like your PC) communicate with the 
outside world (e.g., accessing a website on the internet), 
the communication appears to come from the external IP address 
of your router.Your ISP assigns this external IP address 
dynamically or statically, depending on your service plan.

In summary, the internal IP addresses are used for communication 
within your local network, while the external IP address is used 
for communication with devices on the internet. The router acts 
as a gateway, managing the communication between the internal 
and external networks

Q2] I have doubt do end devices like mobile,pc also have 
   internal and external Ip addresses?

End devices, such as mobile phones and personal computers, 
typically have only internal IP addresses within a local 
network. These internal IP addresses are used for 
communication within the local network and are assigned 
by a DHCP server or configured manually.

In a typical home or office network setup:

Internal IP Address:

Each end device, like a mobile phone or a PC, is assigned 
an internal IP address within the local network. This IP 
address is used for communication with other devices 
within the same local network.

For example, an internal IP address could be something like 
192.168.1.2 or another address from the private IP address 
ranges defined by RFC 1918 (e.g., 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 
172.31.x.x, or 192.168.x.x).

No External IP Address:

End devices within a local network typically do not have 
external IP addresses. External IP addresses are typically 
assigned to the router or gateway device that connects the 
local network to the broader internet.

Router Acts as Gateway:

When an end device communicates with devices outside the 
local network (e.g., websites on the internet), 
it uses the router as a gateway.
The router, which has both an internal (local) and an 
external (public) IP address, manages the communication 
between the internal devices and the external network.
In summary, while end devices have internal IP addresses 
for local network communication, they rely on the router's 
external IP address when communicating with devices on the 
internet. The router acts as an intermediary, handling the 
translation between internal and external IP addresses.
