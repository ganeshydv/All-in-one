   B] With External Network
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Device gets IP from Router: ( DHCP )
    Device ( with MAC)---> Router (have Internal + External Ip )
    --> Router assign new Internal Ip to Device by DHCP 
    --> ROuter saves MAC : Internal Ip  - In ARP Table
    --> Router gives Back new Internal IP to device

2) Device request to Router:
    --> find destination IP : DNS
    --> Device (Internal Ip e.x. 10.0.0.2/24:8080)
    --> Making of Packet in device -Transport layer : TCP or UDP [ HTTP + DATA ]
    --> PAcket : adds both source IP and destination- IP : NO MAC 
    --> send packet to Router

3)  Router to Next-Hop Router or ISP
    --> Router decides device in Internal or External Network 
        based on SUBNET Mask
    --> Router uses NAT ( 10.0.0.2/24:8080-->196.68.10.1:3000 ) 
        changes original source IP of packet
    --> to it's Public Ip given by ISP and maintains it 
        in NAT table with specific PORT
    --> Router adds source MAC ( self mac ) and 
        destination MAC ( this is of NEXT-Hop router - ISP's router) 
    --> to ISP/ to other NEXT-HOP Router

4) to Destination 
    --> destination server - Response 
    --> to ISP/ to other NEXT-HOP Router

5) Response
    --> to Router --> NAT to source IP and PORT ( revere mapping )
    --> to internal IP of Device ( from Router )

6) Response Process:
