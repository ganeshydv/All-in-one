Yes, the heap is typically allocated separately for
each process, and within each process, 
it is shared among all threads. Let's clarify this further:

Heap Allocation for Processes:

Each process has its own heap, which is a 
region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
When a process is created, the operating system 
allocates a portion of memory for the process's heap.
Memory allocated from the heap is managed by 
the process's memory allocator, such as malloc() 
and free() in C, or the equivalent memory 
management functions in other programming languages.
Processes do not share their heap with other 
processes; each process has its own separate heap.

Heap Sharing Among Threads:

Within a process, all threads share the same heap. 
This means that memory allocated from the heap by 
one thread can be accessed and modified by other 
threads within the same process.
Because threads share the same memory space, 
they can access global variables and dynamically 
allocated memory (heap) without any special 
synchronization mechanisms.
However, care must be taken to properly 
synchronize access to shared data to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.
