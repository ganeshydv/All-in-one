Schedualr : a module that uses differet data structure 
to handle which job needs to be moved from 
Ready to Running state
---------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
Process State Queues :
 -
1) Job Queue : NEW process queue. [IN_RAM]
2) Ready Queue : Ready Proocess [IN_RAM]
  - Degree Of multi-programming : how many processes
    can stay in Ready Queue at a time
- The ready queue is typically implemented as 
a data structure in memory, such as a priority 
queue or a FIFO queue
3) waiting Queue

------------------------------------------------
 How Process goes from one state to another ?
------------------------------------------------
1) Job scheduler/ Long_Term Schedular : 
- Moves Jobs from NEW to Ready state
  [ Program from DISK to RAM ]
- Jobs from Job Queue -> to Ready Queue
2) CPU shcedular/ Short_Term Schedular :
- Moves Jobs from Ready state to Running 
 [ Dispateches Jobs to CPU done by Schedular Dispatcher ]
3) for other states:
- there may be different component responsible for transition
the scheduler, I/O subsystem, and process management 
facilities.etc

---------------------------------------

Here are some key points about schedulers in 
operating systems:

Module or Component: The scheduler is typically 
implemented as a module or component within the 
operating system kernel. It is responsible for 
making decisions about which processes to run 
on the CPU and when to execute them.

Algorithms and Policies: Schedulers employ various 
scheduling algorithms and policies to determine 
the order in which processes are executed. Examples 
of scheduling algorithms include First-Come, 
First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), 
Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.

Data Structures: Schedulers utilize data structures 
such as queues, lists, or trees to maintain 
information about processes in the system and 
to facilitate efficient scheduling decisions. 
For example, ready queues are often used to 
store processes that are ready to execute.

Interaction with Other Components: The scheduler 
interacts closely with other components of the 
operating system, such as process management, 
interrupt handling, and I/O subsystems. It 
coordinates CPU allocation with events such 
as process creation, termination, and I/O operations.

Dynamic Nature: Schedulers adapt their behavior 
dynamically based on changing system conditions, 
such as CPU load, process priorities, and resource 
availability. They continuously monitor the system 
state and adjust scheduling decisions accordingly.
