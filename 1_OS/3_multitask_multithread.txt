] Process: It's a running program

-CPU divides RAM/ memory and gives to Process
-in one Process there can be multiple subprocess
 these subprocess if independent on each other 
 we can write logic to execute them using THREADS
 then each thred will execute them in PARALLEL
 i.e. time saving
- these subprocess gets memory allocation in 
 main Process's memory allocation i.e.
  main Process's RAM will be divided
