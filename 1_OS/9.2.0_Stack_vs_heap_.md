Key Differences: in Heap and Stack

1) : both are Memory Region
2) Stack: constant Memory ( managed by CPU )
  - Heap : Dynamic memory ( managed by programmer)

3) Purpose: 
   - The stack is used for function calls and local 
   - variables, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.

4) Management:  
    - The stack is managed automatically by the CPU, 
    - while the heap is managed manually by the programmer.

5) Lifetime: 
    - Memory on the stack is automatically deallocated 
      when the function call returns, 
    - while memory on the heap 
      persists until explicitly deallocated by the programmer.

6) HEAP: common for Process and threads
   Stack : different for Process and thread
7) IMP:  One process can have multiple threds means 
       different Stack but they share same Heap
