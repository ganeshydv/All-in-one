in javascript Object is like base function or parent function for all other user defined or predefined functions

when you call a function it is called in global context i.e. window --> this refers to window

if use strict mode then it local context  --> this refers to undefined 


if you want to configure this to certain object then us bind()
How?  let say there is one object and that object has a method and you wnat use this method there are two ways
to call this method 

  let person={
    name:"tony",
    getName:function(){ return "name:"+this.name}
  }
1) person.getName()
2) using destructring 

  let { getName } = person;
  console.log(getName()); //----> ERROR why beacuse this refers to global context i.e. window so use bind to bind with object 
  getName =getName.bind(person) //--> now in getName fucntion "{this}" refers to person so it will work
  console.log(getName())
