General 6 Ways:

1) Recreate : replace at once : Remove A --> Deploy B : Replace A by B
        : Remove A --> Deploy B --> forward to B
2) Ramped : Replace step by step :
        Replace Insatnce of A not complete A by instance of B : after each instance replaced Remove A
        : B deployment in Process (not complete)--> instance of A replaced by B ( Step by step )--> B complete --> Remove A
3) Blue-Green : Tested --> B Deployed along side A then A will be Replaced
        : B is deployed [ A is still in use ] --> forward to B -->  Remove A
4) Canary : shift traffic gradually from A to B
        : both complete Deployed --> shift traffic gradually to B --> complete traffic to B --> Remove A 

5) A/B testing: shift specific group of user to B  ( Netflix uses this)
        : users are shifted based on some params Ex device type, browser type, locations etc
        : both A and B up 

        [This technique is widely used to test conversion of a given feature and only roll-out the version that converts the most.
