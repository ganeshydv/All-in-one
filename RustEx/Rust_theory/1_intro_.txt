Rust :

-close to mid level but higher level pl
- converts code into executable
- provides security
- platform dependent not like JAVA which is platform dependent
[Java applications are compiled into bytecode, 
which is then executed by the JVM. The JVM provides
 a layer of abstraction that allows Java programs 
 to run on any platform that has a compatible JVM
  implementation ]

CMD Rools:

1] Cargo : initialize repo, track files
- 1. initialize: cargo new project_name
   - - file:  .toml: toms obvious minimal language
     
- 2. build : cargo build (run where .toml file )
- 3. run : cargo run ( build + run )
- 4. check project error - to check code is compailable or not
       : cargo check 
- 5. format code: rustfmt file_name.rs
